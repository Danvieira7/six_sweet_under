                Six Sweet Under was started by Callista Mei; pastry chef, food media host is a boutique 
                e-commerce bakery serving the greater Los Angeles area. Made to order, our treats are made
                with only organic and high quality ingredients; offering gluten free and vegan options as well.
                We take pride in our unique aesthetic and welcome unique clientele. Have you ever dreamt of
                a birthday cake that looks like an actual human brain but thought, “people may think that’s too
                weird, I’ll just get a pink vanilla one...” well, you’re just who we’re looking for.
                Bright eyed, eager and just tall enough to reach the hand mixer, Callista’s love of baking began
                at the age of 7 when she and her mother cracked open a yellow boxed cake mix to make her
                father’s birthday cake. Callista took a natural interest after that and cooking shows became her
                after school cartoons and cookbooks her bed time stories.
